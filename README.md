This README details my own project instructions for Deranged, my first Ruby Maths project.

Instructions:

1) Make it so that if I type 'Ruby deranged.rb' I get a prompt asking for a positive integer.

2) If the input is not a positive integer, or is too large (decide how large this should be) then an error message is shown.

3) Otherwise, the program outputs a list of all the derangements of [1, 2, 3, .... n] for that value of n, and writes that output to a text file output.txt in the following format:
[2, 3, 4, 1]
[2, 4, 1, 3]... etc. for n = 4.

4) It should be possible to easily tweak the program between two different ways of calculating the derangements, so that I can compare the speed of the methods.
